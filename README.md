# Analysis-and-Implementation-of-feature-extraction-techniques-for-classification-of-retina-images-usi
This project is about Analysis and Implementation of feature extraction techniques for classification of retina images using svm and Random Forest. We have divided this project into two phases.  Phase 1 includes the image pre-processing in which we will be re-sizing the image, converting it into grayscale etc. It also includes the feature extraction, which is a technique where an initial set of the raw data is divided and reduced to more manageable groups without losing any important or relevant information. In this project we will be extracting features by using techniques such as SIFT, ORB, SURF, HOG and CNN. Phase 2 of the project is about the classification and optimization of the model. It includes the classification by using SVM, RANDOM FOREST and other optimization techniques. So basically, we will first give the input image to our model, then we will pre- process it, after pre-processing we will extract the features and lastly, we will classify our model. After classification we will predict which feature extraction technique and which classifier is better.
